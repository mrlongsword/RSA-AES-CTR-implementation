1 Cryptographic Primitives for C++/.NET/Java/Python
The followings are some popular packages for Cryptography:
• C++
1. Crypto++: Crypto++ Library is a free C++ class library of cryptographic schemes.
https://www.cryptopp.com/
2. Botan - Crypto and TLS for Modern C++: Botan (Japanese for peony flower)
is a C++ cryptography library released under the permissive Simplified BSD license.
https://botan.randombit.net/
• .NET
1. Security in .NET: The common language runtime and the .NET provide many
useful classes and services that enable developers to easily write secure code and
enable system administrators to customize the permissions granted to code so that
it can access protected resources.

Note: Cryptography Model
• Java
1. Java Cryptography (JCA/JCE) The Java platform strongly emphasizes security, including language safety, cryptography, public key infrastructure, authentication, secure communication, and access control.
Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) Reference Guide:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html
• Python
1. Python Cryptography Toolkit (pycrypto): This is a collection of both secure
hash functions (such as SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA, ElGamal, etc.).
https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/
2. PyCryptodome: PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
cryptographic primitives.

2 Problems
1. Please apply two different packages for the following encryption modes to implement the
hybrid encryption: Diffie-Hellman + AES-CBC and RSA + AES-CTR. You should
encrypt plaintext files into ciphertext files, and then decrypt them. Observe and analyze
your output results.
